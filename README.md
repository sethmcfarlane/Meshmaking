# Meshmaking

This work explores the use of mesh object modeling in Grasshopper, a parametric design plugin for the 3D modeling software Rhino. The series of connected points create familiar, but visually peculiar objects, and project mesmerizing shadows onto adjacent surfaces. In addition, these explorations can spawn inspiration for practical objects that are lightweight and material-saving. The resulting model from Grasshopper was digitally rendered in Keyshot, and 3D printed using environmentally friendly plant-based PLA filament.
